# Coal-Final-Project
This repo contains a program to controlling Character LCD using Smartphone.
<h1>Libraries to be installed are:

  <h2> m328pdef.inc:
    
This library encompasses definitions for the ATmega328P microcontroller, offering symbolic
names for registers to improve the clarity and readability of the code.
 
   <h2>delay.inc:
     
This library includes functions for implementing time delays within a program, crucial for
maintaining precise timing during various operations.
  <h2>UART.inc: 
    
The UART library simplifies serial communication by providing functions for the initializa-
tion of the UART module and transmitting/receiving data through the serial interface.
  <h2>LCD 1602.inc: 
    
This library is specifically designed for interacting with a 16x2 LCD display, offering func-
tions to initialize the display, transmit commands, and showcase characters
